# E-commerce React App with Firebase

This is an e-commerce web application inspired by Mercado Libre, built with React, modular CSS, React-router-dom, yup, formik, and Firebase to store user data.

## Usage

Visit the live application [here](https://curso-coder-react.vercel.app/).

Explore the application and add products to the cart.

Products added to the cart are stored in Firebase, so if you close the browser and reopen the application, the products will still be in the cart.
